# NPTOP

## Overview
This project aims to develop a sophisticated decompiler using a complex LSTM Tensorflow AI to transform assembly instructions into high-level, human-readable code. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the decompiler will also generate formulas and algorithms to address complex decompilation challenges efficiently.

## Features
- **AI-Based Prediction**: Converts low-level assembly to high-level code using AI prediction models.
- **Human-Readable Output**: Ensures that the output is easily understandable by humans.
- **Efficiency Algorithms**: Develops new methods to enhance decompilation efficiency and accuracy.

## Technical Approach

### Data Collection
- Collecting a vast dataset of assembly instructions paired with high-level code by compiling various open-source projects.

### Preprocessing
- Tokenizing and pairing assembly with corresponding high-level code snippets to prepare for machine learning.

### Model Building
- **Attention Mechanisms**:
- **Seq2Seq Bidirectional LSTM RNNs**:
- **Embedding**:
- **Learning Rate Scheduling**:
- **Regularization and Dropout Techniques**:  

### Training
- We Intensively train the model using significant computational resources to ensure robust learning and performance.

### Evaluation
- Thoroughly evaluating the model's accuracy and reliability on a held-out test set to gauge its effectiveness.

### Deployment
- Deploying the model within a web service or integrate it into an existing decompilation tool, making it accessible for practical use.

## Peer-to-Peer Training Program
To enhance the AI model's training, we're introducing a peer-to-peer program that allows individuals to contribute by training the model on their own computing resources. This approach will help improve the model's performance by leveraging distributed learning.

### Key Steps:
1. **Software Development**: Develop and provide a downloadable application that facilitates local training on user's machines.
2. **Distribution**: Make the application accessible on our [release page](https://github.com/rosacry/nptop/releases) for users to download and participate.
3. **Aggregation**: Combine the individually trained models into a robust model using advanced aggregation techniques.
4. **Final Evaluation and Deployment**: Assess the aggregated model and deploy it for general use.
