Building a decompiler that uses AI to predict high-level code from assembly instructions is a complex task. Here's a high-level plan:

Data Collection: Collect a large dataset of assembly instructions and corresponding high-level code. This could be done by compiling a variety of open-source projects and storing the assembly instructions and corresponding source code.

Preprocessing: Preprocess the data to a format suitable for machine learning. This could involve tokenizing the assembly and high-level code, and pairing corresponding assembly and high-level code snippets together.

Model Building: Build a machine learning model to predict high-level code from assembly instructions. This could be a sequence-to-sequence model, which are often used for tasks like machine translation, which this task is similar to.

Training: Train the model on the preprocessed data. This will likely require a lot of computational resources.

Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance on a held-out test set. This will give you an idea of how well the model is performing and where it needs improvement.

Deployment: Deploy the model as a decompiler. This could involve wrapping the model in a web service, or integrating it into a larger decompilation tool.

For the peer-to-peer training program, you could follow a similar plan, but with some additional steps:

Software Development: Develop a software application that users can download and run on their machines. This application should be able to download a portion of the training data, train the model on this data, and then upload the trained model back to a central server.

Distribution: Distribute the application to users. This could involve making the application available for download on a website, or distributing it through an app store.

Aggregation: Aggregate the trained models uploaded by the users. This could involve averaging the weights of the models, or some other form of model aggregation.

Evaluation and Deployment: Evaluate the aggregated model on a held-out test set, and deploy it as a decompiler.

This is a complex project that will require a lot of time and resources, but it could potentially result in a very powerful decompiler.
