@workspace I want to make the #file:train.py file into a program that anyone can use to help train the model given the vast and large amount of data. I want to make sure if a peer decides to stop/abort or pause training the model, another peer can pick up where they left off. I'd also like the UI and design to be appealing in the terminal.

@workspace if i decide to put #file:fetch_code.py file (the merge file between #file:download_repo.py and #file:compile_to_asm.py), #file:data.py file, #file:main.py file, and the #file:train.py file, (which all of these files are in the root of the project) into a folder called exec/ . how can i make sure all of the paths maintain reltivity if i do this?

@workspace I want you to create a file that merges both #file:download_repo.py file and #file:compile_to_asm.py file to its absolute entirety such that once a repo is downloaded, it gets compiled. Make sure the UI and appealing design gets merged in an organized fashion as well.

modify google cloud such that anyone has access to train, remove, and add data.

add readme to repo again


since I made the download_repo.py file such that it will download a maximum of 100 repositories each time it is run. It will skip any repositories that have already been downloaded, when the train.py gets executed and it finishes training a source_code and its corresponding asm_file, it gets deleted, so then, it becomes a paradox if I decide to run download_repo.py (for the second time) after running train.py. What should i do to fix this?
